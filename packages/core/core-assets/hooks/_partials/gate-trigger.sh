# Shared gate detector — inlined into each hook at render time (see the include
# directive in the source scripts + lib/hook-includes.ts). The caller MUST set
# $TRIGGER_RE (an ERE) before the include; it decides which git ops this hook
# gates. Single source of truth for the FIX B/C wrapper-peeling logic; DO NOT
# copy this body into a hook by hand.
#
# Detect whether $1 (a possibly-compound command) invokes a gated operation.
# Splits $1 on the shell separators && || ; | and newlines, strips leading
# whitespace plus wrapper words (`(`, `\`, `command `) and `VAR=value` env
# prefixes from each segment, and returns 0 if ANY segment STARTS with a gated
# `git …` invocation on a word boundary (matched by $TRIGGER_RE). Replaces
# literal-prefix `case` matching, which silently skipped the gate for
# `cd x && git commit`, `echo y; git push`, or a leading space (#88: NEVER skip
# the gate silently). Matching a segment START means a quoted `echo "git commit"`
# does NOT trigger it. Known limitation: it cannot see through `sh -c`, `eval`,
# or obfuscation — a seatbelt, not a sandbox.
# The fast path on its own, so a caller can apply it EARLIER than the segment
# scan — before it has even paid to extract the command from the payload.
#
# Returns 0 when $1 may contain a gated operation, 1 when it provably cannot.
# The argument is the one the block below spells out: no $TRIGGER_RE can match
# without one of the caller's literal TOKENS appearing in the segment it
# matches, and every segment is a substring of the input. So the absence of
# every token is proof that no segment can match — and the same proof holds one
# level up, over the raw PAYLOAD the command was extracted from: JSON escaping
# touches `"`, `\` and control characters, never the letters of a token.
#
# Disarms when $TRIGGER_TOKENS is unset: with no tokens declared there is
# nothing to prove absent, so it answers "maybe" and the caller does the work.
# Fail-open to the SLOW path, never to a skip.

  # ─── Fast path (spec 0016 T3.2, second pass): the loop below pays one
  # `grep -qE` FORK per segment — and a heredoc body or a 40-step compound
  # is 40 segments, so the field cost scaled with command length (measured:
  # 2.8 ms trivial, 14.8 ms for a 199-char heredoc, 95.8 ms for 40 segments;
  # p50 across one real session's commands was 40 ms per hook, not the
  # trivial floor). No $TRIGGER_RE can match without one of the caller's
  # literal TOKENS appearing in the segment it matches — and every segment is
  # a substring of the input, transformed only by insertions (`\<NL>` → space,
  # separators → newline) and prefix-peeling, none of which can CREATE a
  # token. So a single in-process substring scan of the raw input is a strict
  # superset of the segment matches: if no token is present, no segment can
  # match, and the gate answers "not for me" without a single fork. Same
  # argument, same safe direction, as the guard's own fast path.
