# Shared gate detector — inlined into each hook at render time (see the include
# directive in the source scripts + lib/hook-includes.ts). The caller MUST set
# $TRIGGER_RE (an ERE) before the include; it decides which git ops this hook
# gates. Single source of truth for the FIX B/C wrapper-peeling logic; DO NOT
# copy this body into a hook by hand.
#
# Detect whether $1 (a possibly-compound command) invokes a gated operation.
# Splits $1 on the shell separators && || ; | and newlines, strips leading
# whitespace plus wrapper words (`(`, `\`, `command `) and `VAR=value` env
# prefixes from each segment, and returns 0 if ANY segment STARTS with a gated
# `git …` invocation on a word boundary (matched by $TRIGGER_RE). Replaces
# literal-prefix `case` matching, which silently skipped the gate for
# `cd x && git commit`, `echo y; git push`, or a leading space (#88: NEVER skip
# the gate silently). Matching a segment START means a quoted `echo "git commit"`
# does NOT trigger it. Known limitation: it cannot see through `sh -c`, `eval`,
# or obfuscation — a seatbelt, not a sandbox.
