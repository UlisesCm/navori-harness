# SessionStart context hook.
# Injects the harness's live session context — current branch, recent commits,
# and the previous session's `progress/current.md` — into the model's context
# at the TOP of the session, so "resume where we left off" is deterministic
# instead of something the model has to remember to read. Wired for the
# `startup|resume|compact` SessionStart sources (fresh start, resume, and after
# a compaction that dropped the harness context).
#
# Output contract (Claude Code SessionStart): a JSON object on stdout whose
# `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` string is injected before the first
# model request. We build it with node (Claude Code's own runtime, always
# present) so the multi-line context is JSON-escaped correctly; jq is a
# fallback. If neither runs, or there is nothing to inject, we exit 0 silently
# (no context, no error — a SessionStart hook can't block anyway).
#
# Memory (mem_context) is intentionally NOT injected here: the engram plugin
# ships its own SessionStart hook for that, and duplicating it would double the
# context. This hook only covers the harness's own git + progress state.
#
# The `{{...}}` placeholders are filled by `navori render`; do NOT edit by hand.
