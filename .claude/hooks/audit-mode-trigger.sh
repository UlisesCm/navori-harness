# navori — audit-mode prompt recorder (UserPromptSubmit)
#
# While audit-mode is active, transports prompt metadata to the private writer.
#
# It used to also detect an audit-mode invocation in the prompt text and ask
# Claude to confirm activation. That was removed (spec 0013, R3): matching
# `audit mode` as a substring cannot separate INVOKING the mode from TALKING
# ABOUT it, and talking about it is what you do all day while working on the
# feature. The asymmetry made it worse — turning it ON matched loosely, while
# turning it OFF required the literal phrase, so sessions stayed open forever.
# Activation is now exclusively `navori audit --start <id>`.
#
# FAIL-OPEN ABSOLUTE: this hook runs on every prompt. Any error, any missing
# dependency, any odd path exits 0 silently. It must never be the reason a
# session fails to start.

# already trusted — see hook-registrations.ts's module doc). The registered
# command is always `bash ".../.codex/hooks/<script>.sh"` or

# `BASH_SOURCE`, which zsh (#391: hooks run under bash AND zsh) leaves unset
# under `set -u` — is the path the invoking shell was given, and
# `comment-draft-confirm.sh` already established this exact pattern.

# the UX the SessionStart-only flow lacked: no closing and reopening a session
# that is already warm. Costs one stat per prompt when not armed. The stdout
# line is deliberate — a UserPromptSubmit hook's stdout is injected as context,
# so the model learns it is being recorded the moment it starts to be.
# Mid-session coverage is already modeled by the report (recorder horizon), so a
# log that starts at prompt N is a smaller log, never a broken one.
# Shared armed-audit consumption (#597, #599) — inlined into each consuming hook
# at render time (see lib/render/hook-includes.ts). Single source of truth for the flag
# protocol so the two consumers cannot drift apart:
#
#   · SessionStart  — arm BEFORE opening the session (original #597 flow).
#   · UserPromptSubmit — arm the RUNNING session: `navori audit --arm` (from
#     another terminal, or in-session via `! navori audit --arm`) and the NEXT
#     message activates recording (#599). No restart, no lost context.
#
# The flag is `<audits-root>/<repo>/.armed`, written by `navori audit --arm`.
# Consumption comes FIRST: the flag arms exactly ONE session. If `--start` then
# fails, the arm is lost rather than latched — a flag that survives a failure
# would fire on some later unrelated session, which is worse than asking the
# user to arm again.
#
# CALLER CONTRACT: $1 is a session id ALREADY validated against the shared
# charset (#503) — this function trusts it into a command line, so an unvalidated
# id must never reach here. $2 is the payload's cwd (#454: never
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR — they differ in worktrees, and --arm wrote the flag under
# the repo name resolved from the cwd). $3 is the audits root. $4 is the
# authoritative engine selected by the shared hook input adapter.
#
# Fail-open and silent: returns 0 ONLY when audit-mode was actually started, so
# the caller can announce it. A validated flag stays consumed if start fails;
# insecure, malformed or missing flags remain unchanged.
